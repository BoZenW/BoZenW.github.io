journal = {Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics},
abstract = {Rings of trapped ions are an attractive system to study quantum-many body dynamics with closed boundary conditions as well as symmetry breaking. One of the biggest challenges towards such experiments is to sufficiently suppress rotational imperfections of the trapping potential and to allow for instance freely rotating ring structures. We show how to overcome this challenge with a surface trap design and perform numerical calculations to analyze the consequences of various imperfections in detail. We conclude that trap electrode imperfections, external stray electric fields, and local charging of the trap electrodes can be controlled sufficiently well to allow ion rings to rotate freely even near their rotational ground state.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
